# Rollbot: a Spherical Robot Driven by a Single Actuator

Paper can be fetched from [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05120).

This repo is the full implementation of Rollbot, including complete hardware, software, theoretical derivation files.

It's still under construction, so the files might be a bit messy. I will clean it up once the paper is officially accepted.
